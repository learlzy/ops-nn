"""Replay end-to-end examples in-process, for the validation battery.

The battery used to spawn one ``python examples/...`` per case. Each of those
processes pays the same fixed cost -- importing torch_npu and bringing the
device up -- which dwarfs the case itself: on an Ascend950PR box a basic_mmad
case costs ~23 s as its own process but ~1 s as an extra case in a process that
is already up.

Nothing here manages the runtime. The examples call torch.npu.set_device()
themselves and no longer initialize or finalize the ACL context, so cases simply
share whatever the first one brought up.

So the examples are not modified at all. Every one exposes ``main()`` parsing
``sys.argv``, so a case is just an argv: import the example module once, and call
its main() with the argv the shell used to pass on the command line.

See test_battery.py for the case list, and conftest.py for the session fixture.
