## Function

`TileCopyBf16` is a template for epilogue BF16 specialization movement and aggregation. It reuses the assembly logic of `TileCopy`, but enforces replacement of the `Element` type of X/Y/D with `bfloat16_t`.

- Applicability: Atlas A2 and Ascend 950

## Template Prototype

```cpp
template <
    class ArchTag,
    class CType,
    class XType,        // Layout is extracted, and the Element type is forcibly set to bfloat16_t.
    class YType,        // Layout is extracted, and the Element type is forcibly set to bfloat16_t.
    class DType         // Layout is extracted, and the Element type is forcibly set to bfloat16_t.
>
struct TileCopyBf16;
```
