"""Resolve Ascend device id and stream handle for host launch.

Ascend launch takes an integer stream handle from PyACL. Resolution order:

1. ``torch.npu`` current device / ``npu_stream`` (when torch_npu is available)
2. ``CATLASS_DSL_NPU_DEVICE`` env (device only); stream must come from torch or
   an explicit ``stream=`` launch kwarg

Preferring the torch stream matters: example harnesses fill I/O tensors with
``torch.*`` on the torch stream. Launching on a separate ACL stream races with
async torch init/copy and can leave outputs at their sentinel values.
